# Machine Learning Projects
Here I will be posting my Machine Learning projects I have done during my Summer Trimester at NPU

## Falling Prediction using KNN

The project predicts if a person falls or not based on the readings of the Gyroscope sensor and Accelerometer sensor on their smartphone

The detailed project can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshineeRoopakula/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Falling%20Prediction%20using%20kNN).

## Training Linear Models 

In this project, we take the Abalone dataset. The Abalone dataset contains the physical measurements of abalones, which are large, edible sea snails. 

There are 3320 rows and 8 columns. 

The columns include Length, Diameter, Height, Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, Shell weight and Age. 

There are no missing values.

The dataset is stored in csv file named abalone_train.csv which can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshineeRoopakula/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/Linear%20Regression%20using%20Normal%20Equation/abalone_train.csv)

We implement the Linear Regression Model using Normal Equation and using scikit-learn.

## Model Selection 

In this project, we compare two Regression Modesl to see which one has more serious overfitting issue.

The 2 models are:
- Linear Regression Model 1
- Non-Linear Regression Model 2

Mean Sqaure Error(MSE) is used to compare the two models.

The detailed analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshineeRoopakula/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Model%20Selection/Use%20overfitting%20to%20evaluate%20different%20models)

## K Means Clustering

In this project, we have taken a sample data and manually calculated the K means Clustering. 

The detailed analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshineeRoopakula/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Unsupervised%20Learning/K-means%20Clustering)

## kNN Confusion Matrix 

In this project, we are finding the K value representing the best model based on Confusion Matrix. 

The detailed analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshineeRoopakula/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/kNN%2BConfusion%20Matrix)

## IRIS dataset Analysis with kNN Algorithm

In this project, we are working on the Classification of IRIS dataset using kNN algorithm.
